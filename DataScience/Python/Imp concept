hash maps
Hash maps are a common data structure used to store key-value pairs for efficient retrieval. A value stored in a hash map is retrieved using the key under which it was stored.
# `states` is a Hash Map with state abbreviation keys and state name values.
states = {
'TN': "Tennessee", 'CA': "California", 'NY': "New York", 'FL': "Florida"
}
west_coast_state = states['CA']
Hash function
Hash map data structures use a hash function, which turns a key into an index within an underlying array. The hash function can be used to access an index when inserting a value or retrieving a value from a hash map.


 #This is a valid Hash Map where 2 keys share the same value
correct_hash_map = { "a" : 1,
"b" : 3,
"c" : 1 }
#This Hash Map is INVALID since a key cannot have more than 1 value
incorrect_hash_map = { "a" : 1,
"a" : 3,
"b" : 2 }
